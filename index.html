        <h2>Visual encodings</h2>
        <p>
            This NFL visualization explores the NFC West’s use of various offensive formations in the 2016 season. It uses two primary
            visual encodings. The first one is linear. The games are sorted by date, starting from week 1 and ending with
            week 16. This gives the viewer a sense of time. This is important because a team’s formation tendencies might
            gradually change over the course of the season, which may be reflected in the visualization. The second visual
            encoding is the color of the bars. It changes to the primary jersey color of the selected team in order to help
            the audience quickly recognize the change in data set.
        </p>

        <h2>Visual Layout</h2>
        <p>
            I used a bar chart for my visual layout. I think that the bar chart is an optional choice for expressing the data effectively
            because my data will always have less than 16 data points at once (because there are only 16 games in a regular
            season). If I had many more data points per team, it would not be feasible to use a bar chart because the labels
            would get really tiny and hard to heard. It would also be hard to compare value across bars. Luckily, the shape
            of my data complements a bar chart very well.
        </p>


        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <div id="controls">

            <h3>Switch between teams</h3>

            <p>
                The first allows the viewer to switch between NFL teams in the NFC West. This is important because the fundamental question
                the visualization is exploring is how the NFC West used formations in 2016. If the viewer only saw an aggregate
                chart of all the formations of the NFC West teams at once, the viewer likely wouldn’t learn anything meaningful.
                This is also why the “all teams” button was not included.
            </p>

            <h3>Play Type</h3>
            <p>
                The second control allows the viewer to toggle between rush, pass, and both types of plays. This is important because it
                allows the viewer to compare the data for different kinds of plays so that they can find a pattern if it
                is there. I added a "both" option for this control because I felt that it was important to have so that the
                viewer had a way of deducing really strong patterns. For example, with this feature I found that the 49ers
                like to play out of the shotgun quite often. I can quickly infer this by looking at the "both" option, and
                I can verify it by checking the pass and run options and seeing that they are both similar in usage (heavy).

            </p>

            <h3>Play Formation</h3>
            <p>
                The visualization lets the viewer toggle between the 3 available play formations. This is really important because the core
                question that the visualization is exploring is how each team uses different formations. Allowing the user
                to toggle different formations allows them to ask different questions. Each play formation almost represents
                an entirely different domain of data. You could almost do this visualization with just one formation, but
                I think it is really powerful being able to make it so that the viewer can pick between different formations.
                One example of a cool thing you can get from trying different formations, is that you can see how the Seahawks
                changed the way they run their offense through the season. They started out playing a lot out of the shotgun,
                but by the end of the season they played a lot more under center than anything.
            </p>

            <h3>Touchdown plays</h3>
            <p>
                The visualization allows the viewer to toggle between touchdown plays and non-touchdown plays. This control is not central
                to answering the question this visualization is exploring, but it does answer a bit of a side question that
                offshoots from the central question. This question that this toggle helps answer is "what formations resulted
                in the most touchdowns?".
